Since it is hard to put UML diagram in .txt file, I will try to describe it by text.
I didn't put any private/public method or field in this readme to prevent
grader overwhelming by words.

This In this assignment, my previous test are not work well so I simply comment them. I have no time
to fix them sorry about that!

Main:
    - EasyAnimator


Controller:
    - interface:
        - IController

    - Controller implement:
        - AnimationController
        - TextController



Views:
    - interface:
        - IDrawingPanel
        - IView

    - interface implement:
        - Drawing Panel (implement IDrawingPanel)
        - Textual View  (implement IView)
        - AnimationView (implement IView)

    - ViewFactory


Util:
    - Interface:
        - AnimationBuilder

    - interface implement:
        - MyAnimationBuilder (implement AnimationBuilder)

    - AnimationReader



Changes of model in this assignment:
    - I comment most of the throw exception, and just return to end.
    - change check overlap, becaause my previous overlap check will block many animation
        that we actually want.
    - I add a PerformByStep function to make animations change smooth.
    - added a getShapeAtCurrFrame method and a getAnimationAtCurrFrame method.
    - added a set canvas width and height method.
    - added a getCanvasWidth and a getCanvasHeight methods.
    - added getAllShapes method and a getAllAnimation method.
    - I fix all toString functions. for shapes and animations I simply delete all time related info.
        and will add those time related info to getStatus() directly. I did this is to make my view
        and controller to generate output text view easier to set new time depend on user's speed
        input.


Model:

Total files:
    - 3 interface:
        - IModel
        - IShape
        - IAnimation

    - ModelImpl (implement IModel)

    - IShape branch from ModelImpl:
        - AbstractShape (implement IShape)
            - helper classes:
                - position  (helper class)
                - size      (helper class)
                - color     (helper class)
                - TypeOfShape (helper Enum)
            - extend AbstractShape:
                - Rectangle (extend AbstractShape)
                - Oval      (extend AbstractShape)

    - IAnimation branch from ModelImpl:
        - AbstractAnimation (implement IAnimation)
            - helper class:
                - TypeOfAnimation   (helper Enum)
            - extend AbstractAnimation:
                - move          (extend AbstractAnimation)
                - changeColor   (extend AbstractAnimation)
                - scale         (extend AbstractAnimation)

    - 3 tests:
        - test for IShape Interface
        - test for IAnimation Interface
        - test for ModelImpl

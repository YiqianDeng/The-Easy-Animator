Since it is hard to put UML diagram in .txt file, I will try to describe it by text.
I didn't put any private/public method or field in this readme to prevent
grader overwhelming by words.

Total files:
    - 3 interface:
        - IModel
        - IShape
        - IAnimation

    - ModelImpl (implement IModel)

    - IShape branch from ModelImpl:
        - AbstractShape (implement IShape)
            - helper classes:
                - position  (helper class)
                - size      (helper class)
                - color     (helper class)
                - TypeOfShape (helper Enum)
            - extend AbstractShape:
                - Rectangle (extend AbstractShape)
                - Oval      (extend AbstractShape)

    - IAnimation branch from ModelImpl:
        - AbstractAnimation (implement IAnimation)
            - helper class:
                - TypeOfAnimation   (helper Enum)
            - extend AbstractAnimation:
                - move          (extend AbstractAnimation)
                - changeColor   (extend AbstractAnimation)
                - scale         (extend AbstractAnimation)

    - 3 tests:
        - test for IShape Interface
        - test for IAnimation Interface
        - test for ModelImpl
